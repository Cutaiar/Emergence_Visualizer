`Samples` is a music visualization project written in [Processing](https://processing.org/). It uses [minim](https://code.compartmental.net/minim/) to read the samples of a given mp3 or wav, distributes points in 3 dimensions based off of the properties of those samples, and draws lines between them. Ideally, it does this 60 frames per second. However, depending on the machine you are running on, the frame rate can slow and sections of the song be skipped, creating an unintended but beautiful, choppy performance. 

Additionally, I've built in some authoring tools which allow me to pause a song and inspect a still form rather than a sporadic one. An example of one of these "moments in a song" is above. You can see more in this [video](https://youtu.be/DPmrovfai_k).
